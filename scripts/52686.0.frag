// pellicus 2015-07-01 Shadertoy
// My AMIGA's 30th anniversary contribution.

// started from iq primitives.
// switched to a pure raytracing approach
// added the text title borrowing code from https://www.shadertoy.com/view/Mt2GWD
//
// This is my first shadertoy.com production :D
// so veeery far to be considered a well written and optimized code :D.
// Heavly inspired from http://meatfighter.com/juggler/ and totally rebuilt on GLSL.

// This is the Amiga Juggler , a raytracing animation by Eric Graham 86/87 ... yes,
// 28 years ago!. I think this is one of the most inspiring piece
// of digital art made on Amiga after all :D.
// I desired to see it in real time since I've seen it
// on my Amiga, tons of years ago, It was provided as a playback of a precalculated movie.

// I'll try to post a little more about this shader on my new blog next days
//  www.ereticus.com
// a site where I , @pellicus, will rant some heresies ;) and ideas about graphic stuff, shaders,
// raytracing and alternative rendering techs, engine3ds, unity plugins, and stuff like
// that looking at videogames
// and multimedia productions perspective.

// Thanks you all for watching. :D
